# tic-tac-toe

```
As a player,  
So I can start the game,  
I want to mark 'X' on a 3x3 board.  

As a player,  
So I can play against someone else,  
I want each turn to mark an alternating 'O'/'X'.  

As a player,  
So I can know if I win,  
I want the game to end and declare a winner if there is a row of 3x 'X' or 'O'.  

As a player,  
So the game ends in a draw,  
I want the game to restart and declare draw if all the spaces are filled and no one wins.
